# Custom OAuth 2.0 Configuration with PKCE
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your OAuth provider details
# This uses Authorization Code Flow + PKCE for secure SPA authentication

# OAuth Client ID
# Obtain from your OAuth provider's application/client registration
VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here

# Authorization Endpoint
# The URL where users are redirected to authenticate and grant permissions
# Example: https://auth.company.com/oauth/authorize
VITE_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT=https://auth.company.com/oauth/authorize

# Token Endpoint
# The URL used to exchange authorization code for access token
# This request is made from the browser (frontend-only)
# Example: https://auth.company.com/oauth/token
VITE_OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://auth.company.com/oauth/token

# Redirect URI
# Where users are redirected after authentication
# Must be registered with your OAuth provider
# For local development: http://localhost:5173
# For production: https://yourdomain.com
VITE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173

# OAuth Scopes (comma-separated, optional)
# Default: openid,profile,email
# Ask your OAuth provider which scopes are available
# Examples: openid,profile,email,offline_access
VITE_OAUTH_SCOPES=openid,profile,email

# OPTIONAL: If your OAuth provider requires a client secret for token exchange,
# you should NOT store it in the frontend. Instead, implement a backend endpoint
# that handles the token exchange. See README-OAUTH.md for backend implementation.
